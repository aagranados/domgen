* Rename ObjectType to Entity (fits better as we start to integrate services layer into it)
* Remove the define_ prefix from relevant methods
* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* In JPA Models: If inverse is not traversable think about maybe persisting on create if inverse is persisted
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
