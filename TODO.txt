* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* In JPA Models: If inverse is not traversable think about maybe persisting on create if inverse is persisted
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Make exceptions into characteristic containers?
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Add DTOs as a first class elements in DSL (things without an identity that form trees)
* Unify the namespace of all elements in data_module so that an entity and a dto / exception / service / eumeration /message can ot be named the same name
