* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Make exceptions into characteristic containers?
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Stop "boundary" modality from converting enums into primitives and instead make that an optimization of gwt layer
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Start to generate "environment" parameter for gwt method parameters that indicate parameter is retrieved from servlet environment
* Use  javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso in inheritance hierarchies ala Exception/Entity
