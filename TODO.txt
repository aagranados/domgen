* Rename ObjectType to Entity (fits better as we start to integrate services layer into it)
* Remove the define_ prefix from relevant methods
* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* In JPA Models: If inverse is not traversable think about maybe persisting on create if inverse is persisted
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Mixin Characteristic into parameters and results and make method a characteristic container
* Make exceptions into characteristic containers?
* Make enums into freestanding elements.
* Make the jpa facet not reach into java facet except via wrappers. Otherwise excessive setting of packages - particularly when generating enums.
