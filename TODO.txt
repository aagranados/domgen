* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Make exceptions into characteristic containers?
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Move generation of enumerations, structs and exceptions into shared packages for java support
* Introduce the "uses" metadata for service that can refer to entities (a.k.a DAOs) and other services. Use this to generate abstract service with required dependencies and update the uml generated.
* Use javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso in inheritance hierarchies ala Exception/Entity
* For both JPA and JWS we want to use vendor specific extensions. In JPA you want to define the Indexes and other
  database artifacts while in JWS you want to indicate that a service should be validated for compliance with SOAP
  xsd and also you want to use vendor specific extensions to annotate methods/services with wsdl documentation. Domgen
  should be extended to support one vendor per facet, per repository. Then it would default to adding the annotations
  for that particular vendor.
