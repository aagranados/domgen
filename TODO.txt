* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Sometimes you want to enable a family of generators with a single define_generator
  statement. Maybe use patterns ala :jpa* or similar.
