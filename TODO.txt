* Make it possible to define a model check that defines the dependency requirements
  between schemas. i.e. Entity can not be referenced by anyone. Template can reference
  Entity but not Overtimes etc.
* Support constants in relationship_constraints
* Make exceptions into characteristic containers?
* Fix xmi generation: fix existing enumeration/service generation, add message generation
* Add DTOs as a first class elements in DSL (things without an identity that form trees)
